The project focuses on the implementation of an algorithm that solves the problem of finding the optimal route. Its goal is to train a fox to move along a path and reach a specific destination. The fox's movement is represented as a sequence of steps. In each generation, the fox repeats the best sequence of steps, and unsuccessful steps are replaced with random ones.

This project was developed as part of the "Fundamentals of Programming - Artificial Intelligence" course.
